Node.js uses events heavily and it is also one of 
the reasons why Node.js is pretty fast 
compared to other similar technologies. 
As soon as Node starts its server, it simply 
initiates its variables, declares functions 
and then simply waits for the event to occur.
In an event-driven application, there is generally a 
main loop that listens for events, 
and then triggers a callback function when one of 
those events is detected.
